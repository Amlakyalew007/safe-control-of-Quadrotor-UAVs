# Quadrotor Dynamics
The Newton-Euler approach, which is a widely used dynamic modeling method for UAVs, and other rigid body systems. It describes the forces and torques acting on a rigid body using Newton's second law of motion for translation and Euler's equations for rotation. This approach is essential for control system design, ensuring accurate representation of UAV dynamics for trajectory tracking, disturbance rejection, and stability analysis.

 # Fast Super-Twisting Adaptive Backstepping Sliding Mode control
Fast Super-Twisting Adaptive Backstepping Sliding Mode Control (FST-ABSMC) is an advanced control strategy designed for nonlinear systems facing uncertainties, disturbances, and model mismatches. It integrates the robustness of Sliding Mode Control (SMC), the smoothness and finite-time convergence of the Super-Twisting Algorithm (STA), and the adaptability of real-time parameter tuning. By incorporating a fast convergence term and a hyperbolic tangent function.

**Characteristics of FSTABSMC**
  *	Super-Twisting Control Law
  *	Adaptive Gain Tuning
  *	Fast Convergence
  *	Disturbance Rejection
  *	Energy Efficiency
  *	Smooth Control Signals
## Problem Formulation
Since the dynamics of the quadrotor UAV can be subdivided into second order subsystems, we can design the proposed control algorithm on a common second order system as shown below.

## Controller Design
The control law is designed using the above second order system and will be applied to the UAVs subsystems. The control objectives to be achieved in here are the following aspects:

  *	All signals in the closed-loop system are asymptotically stable.
  *	The system output can track the specified desired signal.
  *	The adaptive gains adjust automatically.   
  * A backstepping control combined with fast super-twisting sliding mode control with adaptive gain will be designed for the system control and an adaptive RBF control law will be developed for the uncertainty/disturbance control.

The desired trajectory feeds into both attitude and translation controllers, which generate control signals for the quadrotor UAV model. The UAV is also exposed to disturbances. Its output states are measured and fed back to the controllers for continuous adjustment, forming a closed-loop control system.

# Quadrotor UAV Tracking and Disturbance Rejection Simulation

This project presents the simulation of a quadrotor UAV model focusing on its tracking performance and disturbance rejection capability under external disturbances such as wind. The UAV dynamics are modeled using six coupled nonlinear differential equations that include both rotational and translational motion, with disturbances introduced into each subsystem.

The external disturbances are defined as:
![alt text](https://github.com/Amlakyalew007/Quadrotor-UAV-fast-super-twisting-adaptive-backstepping-SMC/blob/main/images/equation%2011.png)

These sinusoidal disturbances simulate wind and environmental effects acting on the UAV during flight.

The control design and simulation aim to:
* Accurately track desired trajectories
*  Maintain stability under nonlinear coupled dynamics
* Reject disturbances affecting both attitude and position

Simulation is conducted in MATLAB/Simulink, and all models are available in this repository.
